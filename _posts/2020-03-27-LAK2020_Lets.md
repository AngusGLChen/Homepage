title: "Let’s Shine Together! A Comparative Study between Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining"
date: 2020-03-27
---



### Motivation
With the growing interests in utilizing the abundant data collected by various educational systems and tools to facilitate teaching and learning, ***Learning Analytics and Knowledge*** (LAK) and ***Educational Data Mining*** (EDM) emerged as two mainstream conferences for researchers and practitioners to report and share findings that are gained from such data-intensive research practices. As early as in their initial development stage, LAK and EDM had been compared by researchers in terms of their similarities and dissimilarities across several dimensions such as research interests and frequently-adopted techniques. After the development of about a decade, it is time to scrutinize and compare these two venues.

### RQs and Approach

Our recently accepted LAK 2020 paper endeavored to derive a systematic comparison between LAK and EDM [[available here](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=ener%20seen)]:

```bibtex
@inproceedings{LAK2020Lets,
			   author = {Chen, Guanliang and Rolim, Vitor and Mello, Rafael Ferreira and Ga\v{s}evi\'{c}, Dragan},
			   title = {Let’s Shine Together! A Comparative Study between Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining},
			   year = {2020},
			   booktitle = {Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge},
			   pages = {544–553}
}
```

which was the joint efforts with `Vitor Rolim`, `Rafael Ferreira Mello`, and `Dragan Gašević`. In particular, this study was guided by three research questions, which, together with the techniques applied to answer them, are given below.

### Results


To have a fair comparison, we only included publications that are full or short papers from the main conference proceedings into our study. In total, we collected 1,018 papers for our study, in which 436 were from LAK and 582 from EDM. The number of papers accepted by LAK and EDM across the years was depicted in Fig. 1.

![Fig.: XXXX.](www.baidu.com)

#### Results on RQ1
Based on these papers, we identified a total of 11 topics were commonly explored in LAK and EDM, whose names are given together with their characteristic terms in Table 1. Among the 11 topics, the top 3 most popular ones are: **Predictive & Descriptive Analytics**,  **Engagement Patterns & Resource Use**, and **T3 Multimodal LA & Collaborative Learning**.

![Fig.: XXXX.](www.baidu.com)

#### Results on RQ2: Difference of the investigated topics

The overall T-Scores, i.e., a proxy of the efforts allocated by authors for different topics, are provided in Fig. 2, which shows the LAK authors dedicated more attention to the research of **T2 (Engagement Patterns & Resource Use)** and **T6 (Effects on Teaching & Learning Practices)**, while EDM researchers put more emphasis on **T1 (Predictive & Descriptive Analytics)** and **T4 (Knowledge & Skill Modeling)**.

![Fig.: XXXX.](www.baidu.com)

#### Results on RQ2: Difference of community development

We plot the total number as well as the composition of the authors in LAK and EDM across the years in Figure 4. Two noticeable observations can be made here. Firstly, both communities grew bigger and bigger over the years, and more importantly, the majority of the authors in every year were those who had no paper accepted in neither of the two communities before. Secondly, in recent years (starting from 2015), the number of EDM authors who were attracted to LAK were constantly higher than that of LAK to EDM. This demonstrates the increasing attractiveness of LAK to the EDM authors in recent years.

![Fig.: XXXX.](www.baidu.com)

As for the measurement of the closeness between authors, we computed a set of Network Science metrics for both of the LAK and EDM co-authorship networks, as shown in Table 2, which indicates that the EDM authors were slightly closer and more connected to their peers than their LAK counterparts. For example, the EDM authors were connected to an average of 4.70 peers, while it was 4.46 peers for the LAK authors.

![Fig.: XXXX.](www.baidu.com)

#### Results on RQ2: Difference of community diversity

We found that gender distributions of the LAK and EDM authors were highly similar (about 59% were male, 31% female, and 10% unknown). This large gender discrepancy indicates that, similar to many other science and engineering communities, both LAK and EDM were dominated by male researchers. The distributions of (i) authors of different nationalities and ethnicities as well as (i) the regions of the affiliations are given in Fig. 6.

![Fig.: XXXX.](www.baidu.com)

Based on Fig. 6, we observe that: 
- LAK had a larger fraction of Celtic English (i.e., people from immigration countries like U.S., Canada, and Australia), European, and Hispanic, while the fraction of Asian and Muslim was much larger in EDM;
- LAK was more attractive to White and Hispanic, while EDM embraced more Asian and Pacific Islanders;
- There were more affiliations from North America and East Asia in EDM, while more affiliations from Europe and Oceania in LAK.

When it comes to the overall diversity of LAK and EDM in terms of Simpon's index (the higher, the more diverse), we found that EDM was slightly better than LAK in authors’ nationality (0.79 vs. 0.78) and gender (0.46 vs. 0.43) and obviously outperformed LAK in authors’ ethnicity (0.50 vs. 0.42). On the contrary, LAK was slightly more diverse than EDM in terms of the regions of the contributing affiliations (0.67 vs. 0.66).

#### Results on RQ2: Difference of research impact

Table 3 shows that both authors and papers of LAK received a much larger number of citations than those of EDM. This difference is also observed when calculating the average number of citations received by papers of different topics in the two communities. 

![Fig.: XXXX.](www.baidu.com)

#### Results on RQ3

The most indicative words of each topic derived by analyzing future-work sections in the EDM and LAK papers are given in Table 4, which implies that:

- More research efforts should be revolved with the capture and utilization of the data like “posture” and “gaze” on the research of **Multimodal LA & Collaborative Learning**;
- Research on **Reading & Writing Analytics** required more efforts in modeling learners’ comprehension.

### What's Next

It should be noted that the main goal of this study was to depict both the similarities and dissimilarities of LAK and EDM with respect to perspectives like topical differences and community development. Undoubtedly, such preliminary analyses may not be sufficient to formulate "actionable items" to guide the development of the two communities. Still, several implications can be drawn from this study, which can serve as the starting point to provoke more discussion and motivate relevant stakeholders (e.g., conference organizers) to develop more effective strategies to guide the development of the two communities. These include:

- The most under-explored topic in EDM and LAK is **Affect Modeling**, which calls for development of effective practices to share experimental devices as well as data necessary for the investigation of this topic.
- It would be beneficial for them to pay attention to the research published in the other community and learn from each other, e.g., what are the fine-grained sub-topics within each topic in LAK and EDM?
- Citation cannot fully reveal the quality and impact of research work, and additional information should be collected to better indicate their research impact, e.g., the number of papers that have been reported by news media, the number of systems and tools that have been developed and put to use in the real world.
- Effective strategies should be developed to increase the diversity of the two communities, e.g., providing travel grants for under-representative people to present their research in the conferences.
